# Why I need W?
- Let's imagine you're a vibe coder and can't write code yourself (or only a very small part of it), you blame yourself for it but can't stop, and so it goes on and on... then a programming language (I'm not 100% sure) called W comes to the rescue. Its basic syntax consists of just W and one parameter (there will be more in the future).
Usage:

```W
W(n) # Where n is the number of lines, just don't use notes in W itself, it will break (but we'll fix that soon).

```
But if you want to write a little code yourself, then (but this is also random):

```W
print
math
list
random_number
append_in_list
```
