# Why YOU need RANDG?
Let's imagine you're a vibe coder and can't write code yourself (or only a very small part of it), you blame yourself for it but can't stop, and so it goes on and on... then a programming language (I'm not 100% sure) called RANDG comes to the rescue. Its basic syntax consists of just RANDG and one parameter (there will be more in the future).
Usage:

```
RANDG(n) # Where n is the number of lines, just don't use notes in RANDG itself, it will break (but I'll fix that soon).
```

But if you want to write a little code yourself, then (but this is also random):

```
print "Hello, world!"
math (2+2+2)
list
random_number
append_in_list
if (2 > 1) {
  print "2 > 1"
}
var helloworld = "Hello, world!"
funct greet(name) {
  print "Hello, name!"
}
greet("Bob")
```
Usage (this is a temporary solution until a compiler build script will be created):
```
python3 main.py <your .randg file>
```

#P.S.
I have many plans to RANDG, but I won't implement all of them, or project will turn into Trash Bin. BUT, I'll try to release:
- Package system
- Classes
- More readable code
